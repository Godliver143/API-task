# API-task

My first time cresting an CRUD API with flask.Was such a challenge for a beginner like myself but with help from my team members I was able to push through.

CRUD simply stands for Create,Read,Update and Delete

These are the four cycles of an API that allows you to create a database that contains information,gives you the choice of adding or deleting items or information not needed in the database.

Once your database is created you can go ahead and test it on Postman but first make sure all bugs and errors are fixed to avoid having a hard time testing your codes like I did.Trust me that moment wasn't a fun one for me after writing lines of code and running them only to get series of errors and as you keep fixing you encounter more on the way.

So to test your codes,you simply copy and paste your URL in postman making sure you have the GET bottom selected to enable you see your database not forgetting to check to make sure "JSON" is selected instead of "Text" using JSON in my case because that is what I used for my codes and click on the send buttom to see everything listed in your database.
 
 You can also add and delete items by going to "Body" the fourth bar from your left and selecting "raw" right beneath it and once done you can hit send to add a new item to your list and then to delete an item you will need to know the ID and the endpoint of the type you want delete.
 Let's assume that the id is god123, then all you need to do is to send the DELETE request to the endpoint + id:
 A successful delete should return HTTP status 204 (no content).
